# gettys-test

You need to run the API first so that the Frontend can listen to that and send requests

# Running the Apps
- Simple run `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev`
- The API and Frontend will startup at port 5000 and 5173 respectively except something running on those ports
- If you do not have pnpm pleas install at https://pnpm.io/installation# gettys-test
